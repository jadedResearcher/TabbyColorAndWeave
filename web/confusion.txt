I notice I am confused.

If I have both heddle and warp chain groups rendered to the svg (still no graphics) the individual warp chains render to the heddle group.

if i remove the heddle group they don't show up anywhere in the dom.

do svg groups work differnet than i think?

ah i see, the heddle view is still using divs, not groups. whoops. also i made its class WarpChain like a dunkass

so REALLY the problem is NO group really works


alright new confusion actually.

heddle group has two heddle subgroups in it.

but warpChain group has nothing in it STILL.

still don't know why but if i coyp heddle's code to warp chain it works so *shrug*

hrm...

        /*int x = 0;
        for(WarpThread thread in chain.threads) {
            x+= 10;
            new ThreadView(thread, element,x)..renderThread();
        }*/

that seems to break it. why?

~~~

alright so what i wanna do right now is programmatically get a default threading go, then take a break for maybe an hour, clear my head
and THEN Worry about rendering threads.

this'll be the meat of this. does thread veer left or right? i don't fucking know and i hope svg paths can help me.
